# AES Cipher in Rust

This project is an implementation of the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) cipher written in Rust. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used across the globe for secure data transmission. This implementation provides functionalities to encrypt and decrypt data using AES.

## Features

- AES Encryption and Decryption
- Easy-to-use API for integrating AES into other Rust projects
- Secure and efficient cryptographic operations

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your system. You can verify the installation by running:

```sh
rustc --version
```

### Cloning the Repository

```sh
cargo build
```

### Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command:

```sh
cargo run
```

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to use this project in code:

```rust
use your_project_name::cryptography::{encrypt, decrypt};

fn main() {
    let data = "Sensitive data";
    let encrypted = encrypt(data);
    println!("Encrypted: {}", encrypted);

    let decrypted = decrypt(&encrypted);
    println!("Decrypted: {}", decrypted);
}
```
